Social Network Analysis with R on a Game of Thrones Character Interaction Dataset

# Area of Analysis
Hardly anyone has not heard of Game of Thrones since the series began in 2011.
For the few who haven't heard of the seven kingdoms in Westeros,
it is an American fantasy television series, based on the books by George R. R. Martin.
The series is about the power struggles for the iron throne, further threats, murders, intrigues and betrayals.

Without spoiling future fans at this point, the series stands out above all for its brutality,
brutality, bluntness and the death of one or the other main character.
In these consistently brutal conditions, even the one or other supposed hero becomes a murderer.
But what makes him do it ? Are the relations to other characters and the own position decisive for this behavior?

So in the following the connection between the willingness to kill and the interactions of the individual characters,
as well as his position between the other characters will be examined scientifically.
For this purpose, a social network analysis is performed, this captures relationships and relationship structures,
maps these through nodes and edges, which can then be visualized graphically.
This visualization and analysis of the data should help to answer the question and highlight relationships.
